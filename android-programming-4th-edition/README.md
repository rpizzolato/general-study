#### This is a repository for main annotations of the e-book of Android Programming of The Big Nerd Ranch, in order to consult and understand the main concepts.

### Prerequisites
- according to the authors, it's necessary to be familiar with some features of Kotlin, like classes and objects, interfaces, listeners, packages, inner classes, objects expressions and generic classes;
- Androd Studio
- Android Emulator

### Changes in this version of the book
- it's user Kotlin instead of Java (announced at Google I/O in 2017 as official support language);
- use of the Android Jetpack component libraries (AndroidX) in place of the Support Library

### Tips
- enable the code zoom with mouse wheel: File > Settings > Editor > General > enable Change font size (Zoom) with Ctrl+Mouse Wheel;
- in case it is necessary to filter more of one TAG filter, use pipe to show them. Here's an example: `QuizViewModel|MainActivity`.
