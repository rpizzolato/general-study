### IN, INTO, ON, ONTO

Tradu√ß√£o delas √© "no" ou "na", mas o contexto √© que vai determinar qual deve ser utilizada:
- **IN**: descrever a posi√ß√£o de algo que est√° dentro de um espa√ßo ou √°rea definida, indica que algo est√° dentro de outra coisa maior:
  - She is in the supermarket.
  - The keys are in the drawer.
  - She lives in a house by the lake.
  - There's a surprise in the box.
- **INTO**: lembrar que "in" significa "dentro" e "to" significa "para", logo **into** pode ser entendido como "para dentro" (preposi√ß√£o de movimento, quando algo est√° se movendo em dire√ß√£o ao interior de outra)
  - He got into the car and drove away.
  - They fell into the water while playing.
  - Pour the soup into a bowl
- **ON**: indica que algo est√° em cima de uma superf√≠cie (que esteja em contato realmente, pois se n√£o estivesse me contato, o correto seria usar **over** - *the book in on the table*):
  - The cat is sleeping on the couch.
  - I saw the keys on your desk.
  - Look, there's a bee on that flower
- **ONTO**: da mesma forma que *into*, a preposi√ß√£o **onto** tamb√©m indica movimento, mas agora descreve alto que est√° info em dire√ß√£o √† superf√≠cie de outra. Lembrando que "on" pode ser entendido como "em cima" e "to" como "para", se juntar as duas, ficaria "para cima". Pensar em um c√£o pulando para subir e uma cadeira: "The little dog jumped onto the chair"
  - Carefully put the dishes onto the shelf.
  - He climbed onto the roof.
  - The bird landed onto the branch.
